                <p>In this dataset, the majority of patients are females with a medium frame, primarily in their 30s to 60s. Their glycosylated hemoglobin levels are typically around 5%, indicating a normal range. Blood pressure readings vary from 110 mmHg (normal) to 150 mmHg (high), with a majority around 130 mmHg. Waistlines average around 40 inches, and weights range from 100 to 200 lbs. Glucose levels fall within the 70-95 mg/dl range, and cholesterol levels typically range from 170 to 220 mg/dl.

                    We have observed too that the bigger the frame the bigger the glycosylated hemoglobin, which means that people who have a high glycosylated hemoglobin are more prone to diabetes. This research was very crucial since it helped the patients know if they are prone to diabetes or not. Remember prevention is always better than cure.
                    
                    For future research, I suggest focusing more on the glycosylated hemoglobin, and weight, waistline, age, and frame ratio so that it would be more accurate. This research only focused on the size or how many people meet the criteria of the variables whether they are high or low etc. So for future research I will suggest that it would be more specific and accurate.
